peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, Hutt-Twins will be smashed against my armor like evil is smashed falling on Jesus

:The-Twins
  Boba-Fett, there's a business we need to discuss
:_
  this is my territory - programming
:The-Twins
  this is Jabba's territory - and now it's ours
:_
  i dont care what your tablet says -
    your delusion to just-the-magician instruct to build a big-system 
    for you to own and rule the galaxy
  this is Mos Espa and i am the daimyo here - 
    you want power, i'll give you yours - docker and self-hosed
    like Jesus instructs me - give caesar caesar's
:The-Twins
  oh - is that so? why not program all from scratch
  we'll tell you the vision - and you - jus, just - implement
  you are so good - you build so fast - and we have the vision
:_
  you can bring as many gladiators as you wish - 
    who almost-did-it for you just - just-the-excusian -  didn't put it out so they have 0 users
  but these are not the death pits of Duur - 
    private company with hidden code and programmers being chained
    this is github - open source public and free
    this is mediawiki - with millions of users, no - just -
  and am not a sleeping Trandoshan guard
    you think you can tie me up and put in your cellar by threatingly saying this-is-not-what-i-wanted! ?
    like Lee-Mack says - wait till you eat it, pass out and wake up in me cellar
:_
  this territory is mine -  open-source self-hosted thoursands of programmers and millions of users protected
  go back to Nal Hutta - wiki-repent or posts-in-chats-perish
:The-Twins
  you have upset my big-systemsfrom-scratch-sister, i am more patient than she is - she thinks we should kill you
:_
  your cousin Jabba is dead - program has 0 users, excuses dont count
  his cowardly majordomo usurped his territory and then i killed him - he had 20 users? liquipedia has millions
  all that belongs to me now - using your own docker can spin up mediawiki and - give it back to you
  your sister is right - if you want it from scratch, you'll have to kill me for it - and program by yourself
  like Paul-Hogan says - that'll relax you
:The-Twins
  mm
  bloodshed is bad for business - tournament data is lost
  this can be dealt with later
  sleep lightly, bounty hunter

i'm here for the armor - i will be self-hosted mediawiki for tournaments
  it's not a big mission but it's a rocky one
  but i will climb with patience like Alex Honnold and Cedar Wright on Sufferfest
i will take best from
  Liquipedia - brackets
  Wikipeida - wiki, open , a standard
  cloud - docker and docker-compose - Khonshu and Moon-Knight power against Ammit
i will have no ui but mediawiki
  to avoid the trap of just-a-button-here
i will compute ratings
  tournament pages will be of certain format i know with category - tournaments
  i will parse them and write to db - then compute ratings
  and - programmatically write-or-update ratings table to wiki as page
i will generate brackets
  i will have reverse proxy running - Traefik
  using one of mediawiki's request i will intercept and send to my Wichita avatar - jvm or nodejs
  use data from taht request, read data from db about users and ratings
  generate brackets
  and respond with programmatically generated wiki page showing ratings - those pages are temporary
  user can press edit - copy generated bracket - and put into tournament page
i will not be peer-to-peer
  as it is incompatible with serving caesar - like Jesus says - cannot be both peer-to-peer and for Jabba-the-owner
i will not be entirely free - caesar will affects me - but i will entirely money-notion-free
  no money-ads-donate-coins-jobs-fundings-bounties-sponsors fatal error
  no issue scratching on top of our heads
  and bring to a minimum Starlord's smiley corporate coin-thiefy-greedy dad Ego
    who spreads himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple - 
    he'll be smashed against world-standard self-hosted mediawiki

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program - although docker-compose-split like Marc Specter
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healty Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition
  while staying focused on the mission - shield Mando from Moff Gideon
  dont want to repogram the world - i am self-hosted not-custom-but-standard work-already-done
i need a repository named Boba-Fett - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters - yes, like Brad Pitt says - i understand the conundrum of it all
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Boba-Fett
      email = Boba-Fett@bantha
    
    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add Boba-Fett/program.txt file and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from WILTY
  remove issues projects wiki tabs
i will be programmed by one person only - i trust Kuiil with it
  Mando trusts him and so do i
i will be continuously released as i grow as a whole program like Groot
my first Tuskan challenge will be - urun mediawiki and use IPFS p2p-http-proxy to make requests without cloud

i need from Kuiil what Mando says he needs from Kuiil
  except Kuiil needs no couch to crash - sleeping bag/mat is enough - like Bear Grills
  and - as much as Kuiil does not cook on footstoohl - he does cook in heaven - that's the point

i dont want your armor - i want my armor


:David-Mitchell i hate to say it, Lee - but you've slightly ruined my present
:Lee-Mack wait till you eat it, pass out and wake up in me cellar
